# SpeechToText
Simple program using SpeechRecognition library to convert speech to text.

Any video/audio file can be selected - the script will handle the conversion (using FFMPEG) to a WAV file.

Google's speech recognition is an option for the speech interpretation, however this is limited to 50 API requests a day. 
Sphinx can also be used as an offline version.
